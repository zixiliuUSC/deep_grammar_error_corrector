Molten - salt - reactor technology as a one of its six Generation III nuclear reactors, designed with the following factors in place, is safe, environmental friendly and environmentally friendly. However, with all of the different  concerns involved ; this mightn't be the cases. 
Some people may wonder whether SWRC is good , especially for developing countries 
From the previous paragraph of introduction  Penicillium and the phone, we have easily found some similarities . 
For instance, the Singapore needs  restructuring the whole healthcare system due  the aging populations. 
Children should be reminded of the importance to filial filial  and healthy lifestyles. 
Anti - impact cages are added to protect the battery against being crushed 
Besides that,  older workers, who cost more, are more likely to be the targets of discrimination. 
Other than  government spending in the areas of education, there is other alternatives  which can  remedy the problem. 
On the other  hand,  more choices will be made and fewer persons in need will be when there  sufficient economic development. 
Moreover, in the molten salt reactors, plutonium  a key ingredients for advanced nuclear weapon, is  created during  the process . 
But for seidipitous - discovery, the discovery was unexpected nobody would know the possible use of the technology after the  was made. 
Although much effort has been put into R& D, some issues still exist which still hamper engineering design process for innovations 
Hence, the  government should invest a greater amount of resources in programmes that cater to  the mental aspects of the elders so that they can proceed with committed and productive lives after retirement 
Hence, this reactors does not require a very large research period, and cut it down to the very minimum level. 
Indeed, many policies have already been implemented, especially in order for  the aging problem to be eased, especially from  medicine, economic and technological innovations. 
Due to current technologies, hydrogen generated by nuclear reactor reactors is unlikely to completely replaced gasoline for transportation demands. The opponents argue. 
Besides that,  the elderly are once the  people who have contributed to  the growth and development of the country and economy 
This has also proven that it  is feasible to prevent accidents as the SMOM has  made an obligation that all job sites must have a Worksite Safety and health officer before the completion of a Project ( Singapore, 2008. 
Hence, I agree that a person who has known genetic risks should be obliged to tell his relatives. 
Secondly, it  may create a psychological distress for family members to know if the results of the genetic tests are to be disclosed. 
Therefore, even though a prototype has been built, it would have not been possible for it to be tested on  real conditions 
However, there has been recognition of this fact by the fact  the government of developed countries already pumped  a huge  amount of funds to develop  main areas like education, national defence and the development of the economy. 
Today, most  Asian countries  Japan and the Singaporean are experiencing demographic aging, which is defined as the increase in the number of elderly in the  society (  ). 
Futhermore. If we use the LARS bracelets in the reconstructed cruciates ligament reconstruction, the recovery time can be reduced a lot more. 
Likewise, the insurers may make employ of the result to charge higher premiums or not offer insurance because  possible chances  high medical bill in the next ( Chris  2006 ) ( Bryn  2006. 
Advance healthcare facilities  prevent or cure  diseases. 
The MSR, which is able  to be aerodynamically air - - cooled. It is capable of being air - water - cooled 
It is a common cause for  concern,  as more elderly are present in  society. This will affect  economic and societal development significantly 
On top of this, families will have  to deal  that by conducting various activities such as  family day talks, talks  and other government have . 
The individual should not be the final one to reveal his genetic test result. 
Even though it has developed very rapidly in the last decade, it has faced a big challenge now that the nuclear output of China is worldwide dwindling. 
Engineers who are passionate about these "  " no futures " products  form a new group to come up with solutions for the problems, and these " skunk works" groups are known as " Sk1 ". 
Apart from that , the elderly are also burden by the insufficient funds in  their CPf accounts with numerous reasons . 
In my own view, in  high technology societies we are  living in it does not have a final say on revealing  genetic results . 
If the public funds are limited for the aged, they will go for a retirement and may lose more jobs 
Because of such a scheme, the governments have more resources  to focus  more on  other developments  which are as important as competitiveness in the globalised World. 
Furthermore, MSRs being closed - fuel cycle, nuclear reactors are reprocessed taking place minimizing their nuclear waste 
( James, 2008 ) All this have contributed to  painful consequence after the Chernunkhul Accident. They could have been prevented if psychological psychology had be applied to have the crew  more responsible for nuclear safety, and paid more attention  to the safety of nuclear power. 
If we don't put enough efforts to solve  the problem, it may be a  issue in  future. 
Thirdly,  retirement not just solves the unemployment problem, it also lightens the financial burdens on the young. 
Another difference is the acceptance of technology by the majority of the public 
Instead of using taxpayers money on  aged,  it can  generate more job opportunities and higher incomes for the People, resulting  in a better economic development. 
Since VHRT is one  better option among the Generation IV nuclear reactor and it has been feasible, it should be invested and supported in further R&D and research on VHR. 

There should be  a level  to help these aged so they will age at the same dignity and  pride. 
Therefore, it is important for the government to maintain healthcare cost as an affordable level . 
On the whole , the elderly population is a problem problem. 
Some pacifists  because that nuclear energy is also controversial because that recycling nuclear waste, which is controversial, also separates out futonium, a crucial ingredient of a advanced nuclear weapon. 
They are strongly urged to use facilities at  fitness corners to do  light workouts to improve health conditions 
" Now the dispute of patents has been the  trouble for  normal development in some companies 
These breakthroughs  and their  are healthier, happy and with little suffering. 
This indicates a deficiency in resources, whether a monetary or monetary form to support a large number of elderly people. 
They should implement a solution of constructing multiple level  housing and  building since it does not really use much  underground space 
Besides the factor  lead user , we can also consider as the people'singaporeese demands . 
To control the populations, they introduced the 'Stop at two -'policy, which  resulted in the decline of  overall population  till today 
Most of the wastes gases are contained a lot of unhealthy chemical substances that harm the human body  and pollutate the air . 
Research costs include  labor from various departments in the Nuclear plant. 
In order for a country to progress, funds need to be used for investment  in retrenching workers, expansion of economic structures and maintaining the high standard  of education among various educational institutes. 
Millions and billions of dollars will be spent to build  a nuclear plant. 
Additionally, it is concluded that  RFID  has no benefits on the accomplishment or national sec, but  resulted in a increment in the risk of privacy and  security ( , 2009. 
Current reactors in use around the worlds are considered  2nd generation systems or 3Rs, with  1st and 2nd generations systems being retired long ago. 
It is the sound of the waves that travel through matter. 
The final statement by opponents states that the high building cost of the SFR will cause a high construction expense. 
In June 2006 , Singapore's Bus Services  launched Singapore''s first Ever Wheel chair accessible buses service - 21 (  cited in , 2006. 
Firstly, it was through stressing familial obligation and increased the willingness to tomorrow''s grew children, However numerous or productivity they are  to support  their own elder parents through  informal and family channel. 
Nowadays, people with genetic disorders may seek  such testing  to determine whether they are at a risk of developing a genetic disorder. 
Furthermore, the nutritional industry has likewise been up in this fight against the aging problem, with milk products like the quintessentially  that can give the aged the strength and strength to fight against bone weakness and the cell of the brain from damage that can be seen from aging, like  milk thistle and many others. 
In my point , among the six reactor concepts, the sodium - cooled Fast Reactor ( SGR ) is one of them. 
Among all, economic and social policies are widely debated in the societies. 
The RFID tags could be tagged in an item of clothing, under the clothing or in some part of the person's body and they could also be used to serve as  an identifier of the persons wearing them. 
The film was obviously taken by an  camera phone 
" Singapore has an aging population, and these problems are increasing. " ( " Singapore  ", 2003 ). These problems are worsening with time. 
The process heat is provided by the VHRT to support  industrial activities, such as the refining, manufacture of fertilisers and plastic. 
Moreover, the rod is designed with a graphite tips which, if first  inserted,  will increase the reactiveness. 
This reinforces the potential that the  SCWR could not enter  the commercialisation stage of  innovation, as there shouldn't be funding stipulated for the research of the SCRs. 
There are also discussions on age and the maturity level  ( Gill, Denise  and Bar,tha 2009. 
The first factor was the market force. 
For instance,  elderly who  live alone with  no children are living with no care for them 
With the aid from psychology, accidents  are more unlikely to be prevented. 
By limiting public funds on the elderly does not  render their  importance in the Singaporean population. 
In other words ; financial planning, which Peterson ( 2001 ) states to Be a Strategy to a New paradigm of the ageing,  is a strategy that the government should recognise to be the key strategy to achieve the aim of providing a more stable and prosperous Singapore. 
Alternatively, limited Public spending may be ideal 
However, they all were cleared up  by proper advice and much efforts. 
For the case, of the nuclear reactor, helium is the coolants. 
Low - end manufacturing patterns make companies focus  cutting cost  rather than innovation, and lack of protect - goods for innovation make people unwilling  to generate innovative ideas. 
Therefore,  government should limit public funding on aging populations. 
Last but not  least,  training of  captains and  crews  contributed to  accident in  sense. 
There are a wide range of exercise equipments at the wellness station, such as the wheelchair - based walker and pebike. 
To solve this issue, public funds on the elderly can provide  a viable resource to help the aged. This will lighten  burden of  younger generations who will be supporting the aged better. 
Singapore may suffer  from long - term economic losses while possible governmental support for  elderly could be a portion  of its GDP 
According to the Oxford English Dictionary ( 2006  ), engineers are defined as " science and disciplines, art, and professionof acquiring and using technical, science and mathematical understanding to design, implement, and test materials, structure, machines and devices, . 
The economy downturn has also prevented consumers from  buying things  that they believe are not necessary. 
This section of the public expenditure  is a large part of the government  annual allocated budgets. 
Actually, it was impossible to obtain a person to risk a whole life instead of waste five hour on streets everyday. 
For the past , the controversies of surveillance technologies infringing on one's right to the privacy of one've been still exists. This will continue . 
examples of two  projects are the " Nus Eco - cars "2 and the " nus Haptic chair "3 
One of the several reasons given for supporting the claim of funding for the SCWR  is that the SCBR is the combining of two proved technologies which is Light water - moderated reactor ( LFRs ) with supercritical- water fossil plant ( Buongorno,  2002 ), and the supercritical water - carbon dioxide ( CO2 ). 
A report released in the Government Accounting Office even mentions that it was critical of  Nuclear Regulatory Council ( NCC ), which found that it had not increased levels enough to guarantee plants were genuinely secure ; but only when industry officials felt was necessary.. 
Hence, I firmly recommend further funding  for the engineering research and developments for engineers  overcome the problems involved in construction of the VHR. 
The above factors given gasoline - driven vehicles their place, despite electric - driven vehicle being better in the technical aspect. 
This will help them indirectly as  children are taught to embrace  Eastern values to respect  parents. 
Those who are  affluent might  lose investors and talented people which affect the country's development. 
Policies such as the age pension and medical benefit allow her  to receive adequate assistance to cope  the financial problems ( Greg  2003 ) 
For example, According to the national Bureau of Easing and Reform in the United States study by economist Laurence K. Kotlikoffs and Christian H. Hagist ( citation ), " the report found that  annualized growth in governments spending on healthcare was not just top of the U.S. , but it was top of China, at 8.23 %, while that the  rate of development was the highest among the ten countries studied " ( citation 
Therefore, MSRs are highly efficient and efficient 
For example, The Government has increase the retirement  to 63 
One example of  necessary financial supports is the development and upgrading of the current infrastructure used in the education sector, including Information Technology equipment, laboratories and libraries, as well as the laboratory and the library system for the elderly. 
Both are promoting  social development.  People received lots of benefits 
It is hopeful the government will spend money on the projects 
Firstly, the Government has launched the lift upgrading programme for the benefits of flat owner without direct  access to lift. 
For instance Huntington  disease is a genetic disorder caused by a X - linked disorder. Cystic Fibrosis is a caused by an autosomal dominant disorder and many common diseases such as  coronary heart diseases, diabetes  caused by genetic mutation ( , 2003 
Energy- related greenhouse gases emissions from  combustion of natural gas, coal and natural gases have contributed to 80 percent of the total U.S.  greenhouse gas emission in 2006, ( Energy Institute, 2008. 
The government has also gone further than transportation and accommodation to help  the aging population by providing neighbourhood with decent community toilets and community green spaces. This enables the the elderly  to lead a  lifestyle. 
Although this problem may not be solved by the short term, many solutions have been carried out in social policies and science to ease  aging process. 
Mac users, , are limited from the entry system's file. 
However, according  ( Khandedani,? 2005 ), proper engineering designing process, which is the testing phase, is usually testing. 
A strategic commonly use by the government to decrease the financial responsibility of spending for  aged will  be to  use  human resources to improve the country's economy and social development. 
However, we needed to know  that the former incident happened in the generation IV nuclear reactor plant, and that did n not follow the safe regulation then ; hence caused it. 
However in my view, other alternative energy sources, like solar energy, have more possibilities to be  the new beginning for energy. As they have many advantages than solar energy and have a lesser risk involvement. 
Early in the twentieth century, the Chinese government started to set up aircraft factories. 
This imposes uncertain safety during an operation. 
At such a high temperature,  efficiency of  VHRT is about 70 percent, while that of the SGR is about 85 percent, compared to the high temperature of  SFR at that temperature ( Very- High - temperature - Gas- Cooled- Reactor- Systems,2009 ). 
Thus, it  obligates relatives to notify their relatives so as to early recognition of the condition, if any, can possibly be done 
In other words : the incomes  they earned will be constantly being reduced, and more or lesser will be in need of the public assistance. 
", says the quote in The coming of Age in 1970, which clearly illustrates the impact  the rising ageing population has on the world today. 
In contrast,  the Sony VHTR, a desktop computer for Sony, has an battery life that is 2.75 hours only ; hence, it is  not as widely used as the Macintosh Pro. 
Another method that  the Singapore Government has adopted  is the usage of the Public Pension Programs, more commonly known as Central Providently Fund (CPF ),. 
Hopefully, through these studies , the danger of nuclear reactor's operation will not be reduced 
Some people find this difficult to be done so  they even take courses to be innovative. 
Personnel will have a double life in this project 
For everyday products, it would be quite understandable if if the physical configuration of all products were similar for  all, and psychology could have helped designers make  differences by humanically considering making improvements . 
If students do  actively join several activities,  they will  apply solely to rules and theories in school, to work effectively.

In relation to healthcare , Prime Minster Lee Hsing Loong, stated in  National Day  Rally Speech  2009 ), regarding the developments of step down care  and the enhancement of 3M ( Mediseave,Medishield  Medifunk and Medishund ) 
For instance,  collapsed Nicall highway, two stretch of highway  linked by the Merdekan Bridge, was prevented from being prevented from falling. 
Engineers have a compelling obligation  to solve these problems. 
Firstly, the usage of surveillance technologies threatens our  human right to privacy. 
" There are  three areas  that we  discuss that is contributions that the elderly have  made . 
For this case , Compax was in a mainstream of development for portable computers ; but was surpassed by IBM  just for its awesome BIOS system. 
Hence, policy, such as seniors'bonus, which will be given to the aged aged who are 55 and below with an annuity income of up to $ 100,000 or above, will be lighten . 
Technology has vastly increased since the . 
However, the issue is whether  an increase in the aging population would be acceptable or not. 
The workers,  in charge  of the buildings of engineering segment, would have been aware of  the uses  their products made and more would have taken note of the important parts . 
In fact, the usage of the RFID in individuals causes  more harm as it  not only invades our privacy, but also intrudes on our security ( Channel 2000, n.d.. ). Our security would be compromised . 
The strategy makes seniors keep engaging and contributing in the working field. More self - reliant in finance and so as to boost the economy . 
Another perspective is  social determinists, also referred to as social constructionists, which support that society affects and shapes technological innovation, and don't vice  versa. 
It was intended  to be  a machine for recording the sound  of the heartsbeats  mentioned above, but ended up  a device for the cure of certain heart diseases. 
However, the diseases can be treat successfully and fewer than ten died. 
As a result , plastic conduits are very popular among engineers. 
In addition, the power reactor plant is dealing with  very - highly - temperature reactor reactors, such as the Gas - cool fast reactors, which are some of  reactors like the Supercritical- water - cooling reactors even needed high pressure . 
In contrary, the convenience doesn't mean it will be affordable. 
They don't like the products because they don't want to perform well on their own. 
This is because the parts that contributed to  the assembly were bought from abroad and these are better grade material can be scarce . 
Without considering psychological considerations, there will  be a big probability that there would be a good interaction between the man and the machine which would then result in an incident such as the Chernobyl accident. 
The Regulatory framework such  as GeneticInformation Nondisrimination Act  ensures genetic discrimination will be legislated 
As the average lifespan in the global world increases and people become more susceptible to contracting  chronic illnesses, people will become more . 
As new reactor concept develops,  is no surprising that nuclear power is the  " next " big thing. 
We only know  that the Penicillin could cure syphilis, but  we willnever know what disease might be brought about by consuming  penicillin as there exist a lot more uncertainties. 
Education is fundamental to the nation and is fundamental in the nation. 
The Chinese education system has a long history of

With the help of the controller they are  able to use the television  and  DVD player  independently. 
However, this will create an effect that the aged are unwanted . 
Such reductions would provide benefits to the radioactive wastes disposal requirements  and enhance their non - proliferative attributes " ( citation ). 
This gave the engineering engineers the ideas of whether the movie they are viewing is able  become a real reality. 
In this essay I will focus on the environmentally issues that have been brought about from the improvement in science and technological technology and what can engineering designing processes meet these needs. 
By limiting public funding on the elderly, the governments can focus  other developments, such as the economy. 
A federal measure, the GeneticInformation Nondisrimination Act of 2008 ( Gina ), is signed into act in the US, to provides protection against geneticdiscrimination ( Norrggard 2008. 
The elderly can provide for the society through their life experience to make  important decisions for the government. 
This feature limited  its nuclear emissions which lead to health issues like birth defects. 
If one 'd's private information can not protect his privacy, then the result may be made used of on anyone's behalf and hence, this decision is made on an individual requesting  genetic testing 
For a country's money should come from other areas, like defense  and improving infrastructure  thus public expenditure should be restricted . 
Kazuo ( 2005 ) said  that by implementing high chromite steel with a higher strength, the ability of the exchangers to heat the water and the water can also get enlarged, making the piping also shortened and  loop number  also got smaller. 
Additionally, since  Supercritical- Water - cool Reactor is a supercritical - water - cooled reactor, its designs features considerable flexibility by reducing  containment volume, reducing the  volume and reducing the need to recirculate and jet pump, pressurized steam generators  and steam separator and dryer ( Idaho, 2007. 
Though decades of  self - reliant had taught the Singaporeans the importance of self reliance, now it can no doubt be taught the students to stand strong and learn to support their own and their families solely. 
In conclusion, the people should  have the rights to restrict others from revealing the result  as psychological  and social  impose great  on people . 
While there is  a highly increased demand in engineering students with acverability of design and the ability to make innovations, there is also a highly  in education system for engineers with a lack of experience in design. This is because the lack in practice in schools and the lack  co - curriculum activities. 
One of the examples is the government, which is facing the problem of an aging population, and is looking for solutions to the problems. 
This shows that . 
In the same fashion, once a school level has been raised, students can be  more aware  how to care for themselves as they age. 
Public spending should be reflected in the current  of the aged citizens. 
A country with  flourishing economy found investors more easily to invest in and the population stands to enjoy a range and range of material comfort that a flourishing market economy  can provide. 
Nevertheless, there have been data protect technology that has already been in place for preventing unauthorized individuals to access. 
Meanwhile, people are intending to buy brands goods helps to . 
However, the former does not possess a specific  objective. The discovery is solely a matter of. 
Instead engineers think about another method -- use nucleoynthesis, a fuel of nuclear reaction, which is just an ordinary kind of pot water from the  sea. 
In conclusion, innovation is to make the life of the user easier for them. 
Hence, public funding should be diverted to the aged population. 
Engineers do face  tremendous pressure everyday when an engineer's accident occurs 
Basically, families with more than ones child will receive economic support  and ease  ageing process 
On the other, it could also be said that raising the age to a certain age and government  help in the form of baby bonuses and Children Development Account is temporarily, . 
No one can infringe on one 'd his or her will (  UDHR ). 
Additionally, the Government has provided a  $ 30m grant for National Centre of Social Service ( NCS ) and these under its umbrellas to execute  social services for the elderly 
In a world with technology fitted seamlessly in, the threats of global cooling and rising energy needs, which affects our future of the planet have never been higher. 
Thus, there will be no need to the individual if his family members decide to tell their genetic relatives about it. 
So, there should not be limited  public spending  on the age group so  money can  be diverted  to other sectors of the country which will provide better returns for the next few years. 
However, public funding should be channeled to other area of the country's development like the economy and technological innovations which may assist in prolong and enhancing its quality of living for the aged. 
In addition,  private companies, may not  hire people who have high - education qualifications and rich knowledge. 
For example, a product which satisfies the requirements of safety will be labelled as being safe to the highest possible level. 
This setback is especially pertinent in those countries challenged on an ageing demographic with low birth rates and low retirement to work population. 
When more elderly  are employed , there would be less employment for younger workers, as well as a more effective workforce. 
For example,  according to  Singapore's budget report  2009,  the Senior Citizens Bonus is  $ 78400000.  
With the advancement in technology in information technology, many device have been created to help  the aged , especially  home -bound or with healthcare  difficulties . 
The first radio was able  only simple messages, still  was valuable . 
Hence, more often, than not, one should  be frank  about one 'd genetic test result. 
In conclusion,  public spending  should be controlled so that money can be used to other developments 
As the country has less working forces in 2030 and the government  to invest more on education, the money should be diverted to the education sector to obtain  stronger working forces to support  the country. 
) However, insurers have the right to judge whether the declarations  are truthful . 
For example,  time taken from one person to another in a distance  of a couple hundred kilometres  reduced from  2- 3 days to  2 hours. As a result  humans are  able to move instantly. 
It is known from a healthy life, that by being healthy, one  will have less health problems. This will thus, be spent less on health care. 
Hopefully in the very near future  more effort would be put into encouraging society to  be more welcoming of new innovative innovations that  would greatly improve their way  life for  better,  and  in not only aspiring engineers, but students  in general  skills that  can be used  in handling problem  in the actual world. 
Then, another  question arises : what hampers innovations in the engineering design process? 
In conclusion, the government can impose laws and limit  use of the surveillance technology. However, we have to limit it. 
Singapore transportation consists of Mass Rapid transit ( MTR ), the Singapore Chang i Airport and other. 
Its high requirement for computing knowledge  makes Linux a not popular OS among average computers. 
In other words  when the technological technology becomes  more mature, and more profit - generating, it will be very hard for it to guarantee  it will not only be used for good use, but also be used in good stead. 
In the USA , since the beginning,  nuclear power cost this nation over $492,000, 000,  twice the price of the Vietnamese War and  Apollo Moon's missions combined. 
Fourth, the differences between accidental inventions and research on developing products is  which problem they are solving

With the current policy such as the upgrading of  residences ', the ageing process has become eased to the extent of being eased.. 
Two of these problem involve the  political environment  and Chinese  mindset,  which already has a negative influence over several stages in the engineering design processes for innovation  in China 
The substantial cost  generous elderly cares will not fully be supported if their financial position  is in  predicament. 
Thirdly,  the introduction  many new medications has helped  the aging problem to be eased. 
Conversely, there were nobody who invented the energy for the microwave oven before Percy.. 
It can cause a low in the labour force, and a population of about a million ( Butler, 2004 ). 
Nuclear power energy was being claimed as the  most desired energy source by many people, especially those who are old and who don't wish to see nuclear power become obsolete ( Butler  2004 ), because nuclear energy is a sustainable energy source. 
Engineering design has also provided us  many convenience, as micro- chips in laptops which  faster processing speeds and lower costs, as huge as the International transportation. 
Although this may increased the government  expenditure,  it is necessary to invest in the better  future of a country. 
Another worry in  use of the technology that when a hacker is able to get in a system, his personal information could be exposed ( Zter, 2009. 
This greatly encourages independent thinking among thelderly, and  emphasis personal responsibility on. 
Most countries,  now,  should be conscious of the increment  the ageing populations and also be  heavy on expenditure it will bring about. 
These are complex socio problems that could significantly impact on other members  ; hence, the development of a country,  not being handled appropriately 
After careful design of and hard processes of trials , the  electric fan first appeared. 
Similarly, penicsillin is a first antibiotic used to treat infections. 
In this economic - driven society  taking too many of the  public''s public resources to provide for the elderly don't bear well for their future. 
Next step will  gather information. 
In conventional way  one should received an approval by the corporate  executives due  to the corporate bureaucracy in the order of doing the project

But in addition, a  pool of reserved funds should also be available for the rising  population as a result. 
The new generation IV nuclear reactor is promising an excellent solution to the energy crisis. 
Global aging is  a term used to describe the aging population, and population ageing, has become a common issue in the present. 
However some companies  retain their old workers because they are loyalty but  if there was a crisis they would still be  the first to get lay off. 
Both smallpox and penicsillin are tremendously discoveries that have saved people's lives and  are milestone  in medicine  lead people  to explore  new areas . However, the procedures of finding  these two inventions and the  development of these two are different.. 
Indeed, for  penicillium, Fleming  not only anticipated the discovery  of peniccillin, but also researched on the characteristic of bacteria in bacteria. 
Moreover, the increase in emissions of carbon carbon dioxide by burning of coal, which was proved to be a significant factor in causing global warming (  ). 
This is especially relevant, considering the fact that Singapore has had one of its fastest aging population in Asia . 
" Thus, the luck is needed at every success experiment,  or even serendipsity,, which required more luck . 
This scheme is  because the governments have control over an  large number  HDB flat, which constitute  a large  land area 
Various ethical and sociological complications arise due to the differential treatment of those subjected to, to telling or not telling their families and relatives about their positive results. 
( John, 1996 ). Furthermore, the lead - cool fast reactor would be much more safer compared with the conventional plant with a more comprehensive safe features. 
All of these experience show that nuclear energy is really scary. 
By providing more  for the aged and improving health care, the governments can actually help to improve the lives of the elderly which will decrease possible social problems. 
This is because the reactor is being designed to work at a temperature of  10000C, which is one of the highest temperatures used among generation IV reactor to generate electrical electricity by utilizing the same amounts of fuel as the generator. 
It may be claimed that the legalisation of the genetic information Nondisrimination Act  may solve  discrimination (  2008 ) 
However, the government stresses the fact that these plans don't  entitle all residents to share  their own benefits through means testing, where the individuals  are accessed  according to the financial situation, bill size and availability of the items. 
Compared to technical reason, social factors are the major obstacles for innovations, and financial and education are among the reasons. 
Hence, the costs of operation would not be as high as claimed 
But there is not doubt that  public spending  on the elderly should be  limited because  affects the amount of funds being diverted into areas that are more important, thus more importantly it is  the level  the country has  to take into account. 
A decrease in  spending to meet the constant  needs of the aging population would not be worth  the economic losses resulted from communication breakdowns. 
48 ). 
seeing this problem , the governments decided to improve the lift system, so that we can use most HDBs'lifts now. 
The decrease itself  can be a result of 2 different factors : the low birth rates which mean the problem is because the problem arose because the lack of youth in the workforce and the low education, which means a problem arises. Because the shortage  of well educated youths . 
Restrict spending on  aged doesn't mean that the government shouldn't spend on it. 
While not compromising  benefits it raises, the ethics and moral concerns regarding surveillance technologies far outweigh its benefits. 
While conventional research require the researchers  to do a large amount , discussions  and management . 
To add on , Decline spending on  aged could  raise social problems 
Critics of this view point out that the misuse  funds once  made available is. 
Therefore the government has to strike an even balance and  the amount  is reasonable enough for  usage. 
A recent research  that lighter meal may prolong people's life by  calories - restricting diets. 
The aged should be forgotten , but spending  on them  needs to  limited. 
With human population  rising at a exponential rate and peaking in at an estimate 9.01 billion in  2050, the energy consumption of the world is too  expected to  rise proportionately. 
First of all  the biggest problems are the whole countries lack money. 
To conclude,  the arguments  against the safe and costuming of VHR are valid. 
" (  ) With a more investment from education,  the standard  working force among Singapore will be increased. 
However, these  arguments brought  up by  opposition did  not consider  water and the space as vital to humankind. 
According to the  book by  David G. ( 2009  ),  ten building steps in the Engineering Design Process. 
A society that  children will have to take care  their parents  will help  the government to ease  spending on  other areas in the country 
Thus, it would be inconsistent to say when we would be talking about safety . 
Critics of this opinion may argue against disclosure  the potential of loss of personal privacy. 
Firstly, encouraging late retirement for the elderly can dramatically change their attitudes towards work 
Public spending on  elderly should not be limited . 
The very high thermal reactor can produce both electricity  and hydrogen  and it can allow countries  self - sustainable in terms of energy production. 
Then the WNAO ( global association nuclear operators ) was established. 
Being prudent, the Singaporeans tend to be more adventurous compared  their western counterpart. 
With the advance of computing technology  in the 1980s and the advent of cellular network in the mobile phone, a cell network on the mobile phones call Grouper Special Mobile ( Farleys, 2007  ). 
There are many  existing initiatives  that the government can play . 
Many people think  that not just the Nicolic Highway Collusion incident,  most of all the major accident was unexpected and  were mainly  caused by mistakes in human judgement. 
With the help of modern technology , humans have been able to produce increasingly efficient gadgets which are capable of storing relevant personal data or to tracing one'singing one'location. 
In addition, the regular novel upgrade to its websites continues to entrench more web surfers  as well, generating more Internet traffic to its site. 
Peterson ( 2001.  ) mentioned that health care was once a means to an occasional visits to the doctors, but today it is a lifelong problem. 
While, different governments have different ways to perform the stages. 
Thanks to the technological inventions of e - commerce, these shop can now promote their goods to a more large target group 
This is because the Singaporeans have been encouraged and are educated to  be financially self - dependent, self- reliant and planning for their  age, so as to not be overly reliant on the Government. 
First of all ; the government  will affect  the engineering designs process. 
In the other word, it reflects the public consciousness to protect elderly rights , eliminating the elderly people 's  negative self image and increasing the capacity of policy - makers to influence the policy -making process. 
Opponents of tracking using the RFID  say that  tracking weight the important health privacy of  people tracked. ( Tan, Li,2008 ). 
According to the Austrian Institute for Ecology, the performance for the SFR is highly dependent on its closed fuels system which is recycles 100 % of  actinide in its processes. 
The introduction of newer technologies and treatment for the old are relatively costly. 
If this trend continued, Singapore would be second behind Japan in the percentage of the elderly aged. 
With less fuels , it produce electricity and water four to five times greater as compared to high temperature reactor  ( " The Generation IV Nuclear Reactor, " 2008 ). 
Besides the storage tank, freeze valve that will  automatically open when it detects the salt being stored in it is also installed.. 
For example,  a country may decide to increase its spending on  aged by lessing lesser funds allocated for  education,  research and investments . 
Some people think that  the national economy is a burden  because old people do have the rights to enjoy  public money while others think that old persons have the responsibility to enjoy it. 
( , 2009. 
Hence, only countries that have built a nuclear reactor  produce electricity 
Not only that, the waste materials being produced from gas cooled Fast reactors are pure plutonium, which is mainlyused for weapon production. 
An increasing number of deaths due to motor vehicle accidents has become a serious problem in most countries. 
Furthermore, Governments can focus on areas such, such as educational and economic development as tackling the problem with an aging population , will kill two birds'with one. 
Instead, investing more funds in education may increase the  of the young people to provide better jobs and enable them to form families, and enable their parents to form a financial support for their elderly children. 
One good example is Japan. 
In order to cope with this problems, the Government has opened  doors to foreigners to work  in Singapore, so that  companies can employ more caring - giver to help  elderly. 
Therefore, with  progressive economy , many choose to establish  careers before they have children. 
After this production process, many more rival brands followed suit. 
Further research and developments are worth and need to be made to overcome these challenges and to  turn this reactors into reality 
While viewing from  latter would imply that it would be due to  societal factors  ( Rogers  2003 ),  ( 2003 ) 
Moreover, the users may take either the product as a real product and the fake ones are even more attractive . 
In this case  third parties, such as doctor should not disclose  as doctors  usually are more concerned with alerting  the person  of the potential risk of contracting  the genetic diseases, rather, than the potential negative impacts  may bring on the person 
( { http, //www.orcbs.msu.edu/rctr/statistics/statistical_statistics_statements/statements.htm? data = { \ * } [ \ * ] { http } [  ] ). These figures show that the Chernobyl accident was mainly due to the use of neutron to collude with another nuclear reactor. 
Opponents are fearful about the dangers of nuclear reactors. 
Investment in a good health care system would guarantee that the aged population is a healthy and therefore more government  attention could be directed towards issues like economy development and so on. 
These problems that might hamper  engineering design will impact the new market, causing the market to be unavailability and changing its mindsets. 
This, in the turn will cause a misguidance impression that the medical fees for the elderly is high, and thus, result in the debates between the governments and policymakers whether to restrict healthcare spending  on the elderly . 
The other factors  influence the  development of Radio are military demands and economic demands. 
Rather than having  married couples to look out for their parents , it could be the married couples who live off the children of their own parents, who live on the side of the society. 
This has resulted  different products being developed by different environments. 
We do acknowledge  that the elderly population will be required to a large extent of a government's budgets to support their various welfare programs. 
Currently, Japan has faced financial difficulties  gathering funds to fund its National Pension  Employee 'S Pension and Employees Retirement Insurance. 
Not only that , all  residential committees and community centers in the neighbourhood of Singtel Thi Minh City in Singapore are promoting the meaningful and  health program for the needy elderly in Singapore. 
In contrast, the vaccine discovery was a kind  technology based  on a sequencing of basic scientific research,  followed by applying research, which led to the development of the vaccine. 
However, Tata must realise that  the car  is not going to  India but will be marketed  in other regions. 
However, critics might argue that  human error could not be prevented if human are involved in  the process 
In fact, work helps the elderly become  more independent and more enjoyable. 
To deal with these challenges, researching and development, as well, has come into being. 
All these energy produced by the  very high temperatures reactor will be reduced . 
Now, this problem has become an issue for the nations that the population at present is lacking in creativity and innovative ability. 
Funding can be  in the forms of pocket - money, subsidy school fees  and more scholarships for the poor families. 
On the other  hand,  electric efficiency , considered to be a valuable energy source, is usually 33 % or 48 %, efficient. 
( Nuclear power 's New Dawn ) Different forms the caution that we must put in using conventional nuclear power plant, now it can make  most of the electricity we need. 
Since everything provided  by the governments is considered  a right  people,  more subsidies  will be generated. 
Report from the Government of the Singapore, 2000, showed that in  2000, about 9 out  senior citizens  above sixty- five years olds were living together together with  children (  2000 ). 
Therefore, individuals  pay for whatever is wanted  and only need  subsidized  government to cut public spending . 
This was very few if it were meant to give him rewards for his hard work, 
With the pessimistic views about the  current global  oil supply and pessimistic views of the future, these governments hope to triple their energy supplies using nuclear reactors. 
As a most importantly aspect to  the development  of science  and technology , engineering designs for innovations play a significant part in the  Chinese society today. 
They will tend  to feel frustrated because they will need to raise funds for themselves, putting into their utmost effort when developing their products, only to discover that their product faces rejection by  the public 
This nuclear case illustrates the point that nuclear power is just a case study in the fact that nuclear energy is just such a powerful energy. 
Discrimination has been proved to have detrimental effects on People, such as  high risk of depression. 
The experiencing and the understanding of the aging process changes the society's thinking about aging, taking the issue on an entirely different level of human instead of being practical. 
Description, the  heart pacemakers make a tremendous contributor to the  patients who suffering from the . 
The problem of a psychopathology in design is one of the problems faced by engineers in this accident. 
There are several simpler methods of paying for items using credit cards such as punch the card in POS machine, wireless payment and network payment. 
However, the  VHCR is initially being designed to be used as its  coolant, which is  not the best suitable for  passive heat removing systems. 
In contrast,  public spending  on the elderly should be  limited and  for the  less well off. 
This is not very good among the users as it may affect the quality of the machine. 
In conclusion, the majority of the policies in the easing of the ageing process . 
compared with going shopping online or watching TV on demand, it costs people time to search for information through searching engines. 
Though, they might assist the patient by informing him or her of the likelihood that their relatives will contract the same disease, the last decision ultimately will still depend on the individuals. 
They were over stressed by teachers, as knowledge was or information  was provided  in an overimplified manner, causing them to be over reliant on teachers 
These elderly will be able to enjoy  supplemental  retirement income from the CPF . 
After all, although all the developments of ideas  improve  safety, costs is a significant concern whether such ideas can really be implemented. 
The theory by  researchers from the Harvard Medical school ( as quoted in Reader's Digest, September 2009 ) suggests that " more Sertuins  would enable the subject to maintain  youthful or healthier gene patterns into oldage, eliminate the traits of the aging and thus increase lifespan  24 to46 percent. 
Who knows, the hybrid cars, might actually managed to successfully  propel the gasoline - powered cars to the near Future. 
Nonetheless, with  advanced architectural technology and economy status, the lifestyle for  olds can  be improved a relatively large extent.. 
" (  1993,  ). By releasing  results without individuals'consent, will subject an individual to  a violation  his human right. 
He cited a study showing that the population ageing process has been an important source of stability and economy development in most regions. 
However, this  seldom occurs due to  the fact  most of these people don't want to continue work into oldage, they feel that they are entitled to rest 
Two major problems  are : The low acceptance rate of engineering designs and the complicated verification procedures for licensing of engineering projects 
This article will concentrate on two  problems that hampers the innovational processes of China and  their impact in certain stages of the . 
Many of the sources produced inadvisable air pollutants  which are  very harmful to the atmosphere. 
The use of the  solar energy  has been very encouraged by  environmentalists. 
Therefore, skunksworks environments usually are  not comfortable . 
These collaborative efforts have resulted in the building up of six possible generation IV reactor concepts as the Generation IV reactors. However these concepts were still unattested and they would require further extensive testing before they could be used as production. 
Besides, entrenching an older person who is no good at technology with this device might be a dangerous situation. 
Children should be reminded of the importance  filial filiality since young, to ensure  that they  don't neglect  their parents . 
Thus, this will ease their aging processes through providing the elderly a more  comfortable and  easier life . 
Individuals'privacy might  be infringe. Information is easily accessed by anyone whose access to  surveillance technology and also  there might  detrimental health effects on the individuals who are being tracked 
And the experiment result came out . 
Biofuels were obtained from live or lifeless  organisms CitATION Tcl07 \  1033 \ l1033 ( tscheper, et al 2007 ). It may be  solid,  liquid or  gaseously formed ; plant oils, ethanol, biodiesel and biodifluoroethane are all  biofuel. 
They may have a medical check- up more regularly and if any disorder  can threaten a person's life,  it will become better when it can control the disease when the disease has n'sn't. 
And I have an absolute trust  scientists to  rectify the flaws in the RFID technology to make it truly the 
They are afraid  they can no control changes to their daily lives. 
Besides, it is also expensive to deal  spent fuel  and radioactive wastes. 
Also, couples may be mentally ready for their children's futures as early diagnosis of diseases, such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, can prevent deaths. 
Once you are overseas, there are nothing you could do ". Golda said. 
The Housing and development Board has been building  studio apartments  to accommodate the senior citizens. 
Singapore's educational system is structured in a way where it is structured such that it . 
It recycles  nuclear fuel  through a recycling process where a group  chemical elements  are produced. 
( Generation IV international forum GIF and the U. S. Nuclear energy research Advisory Committee  ) This poses as a threatening threat to the workers  due to  corrosion of  materials. 
This aging population  affects the  economy because it affects the high retiring rate and  increased need for healthcare for  elderly. 
However, public funding on the seniors should be reduced so that funds can be diverted to other important areas of the country's development such, taking care  the needy , the elderly and infrastructure 
If we were  compared the amount  greenhouse gases emitted from fossil fuels  compared to nuclear power , there are an astonishing number of harmful gas emitted by the fossil fuel - producing plants. 
Aging statistics taken  from the US of America's administration of the aging shows the people above  the age  represented 12 % of  population in  2000 but they are expected  to grow  20 % by 2030 
Hence, I believe that the relationships between the generation and the generation should be nurturied and the child will take care  the parents. 
I hope that  future generations will be able to take part in the caring for our Mother Earth by using such hybrid vehicles as it minimises greenhouse gases . 
On the other, some  argue that although the elderly spent their time on their  children, they 'd now be the responsibility  of the child to look for their needs . 
Therefore a worldwide  policy was  banned from being implemented. 
Since electric vehicles  are very heavy, they are quite fragile . 
For instance,  a conventional generated invention  . 
In consideration that the frail elderly have fragile bones, the more resting areas with lower seating areas are also build to fulfill these needs. 
compared to the two inventions, it seems that more element of luck is present in both of the latter two. 
This will decrease  the number  elderly that are being funded from the governments to get  in their  age. 
Meanwhile, some engineering students at Rockwork International also spotted that a significantly amount of  ice built  on the  service structure . 
Nowadays, the people are debating about the  research and developments for  generation IV reactor. 
The Generation IV international forum ( GIF, 2006 ) has  researched in the four different types  nuclear reactor  which they believe  will be of the generation way of generating nuclear energy 
Surveillance technology refers  gadgets that  observe and track individuals'behaviors and activities from a distant using electronic equipments. 
" Education  is important  it teaches our people the right behaviors, the right manners thus  making us civically civilized. 
For the VHRTR,  costs are mainly associated  with the thermal exchanger  size and installation expenses, which usually range from about US$ 781 to US$ 912 million. 
Despite the technological deficiencies , psychology can be implemented  to stop a challenger from launching. 
However, the risk gene carrier may  argue that  telling the information about his genetic disorder to his family member would be a violation of his or their autonomy. 
There are several developing countries such, Japan, the US and the Singapore, predicting that an educated aging population will have a longer life expectancy than the generation that preceded it. 
Last but not least, all technology must  be well developed using advanced technology skills. Otherwise it will least likely to fail out in  market. 
Moreover, if a developing country has insufficient funds and it is unable to approach the AEHI fund, it can approach the AHI fund for financial support but the alternative way is building smaller- scale plants with the need not to use expensive power grids and thus . 
As people are  having a high life expectancy , more expenditure is expected  providing better healthcare services and other  services for  aged. 
As mankind has entering the 21st century,  fuel has became increasingly pressing. This has surpassed the amount  fuel required to be in the present century by the most 50 %. 
However, our heavy dependence on foreign talent will put the Singapore in  a vulnerable situation in the short run where  foreigners do have loyalty to Singapore. 
" ( Bell, 2009. Penicillium is " The first drugs " (  ). Although many  bacteria have  resistance to Penicillation now, they are still in widespread use. 
Thus they will then be subjected to testing and treatments for that particular disease as quickly as possible 
With such a small number of people to support  the elderly , there will be a  need for a government to  remain at  its current expenditures on the elderly. 
The challenges faced are never ending as engineers in order for them to come up with a new medical device that is currently and which will in the near future. 
The post - its pads were  only found  after they were given to  3M's president's executive secretary, who found the product useful and distributed it on various companies 
As such, these initiatives will ensure that the minimal of initiatives is carried out  to guarantee the elderly are able to extend their work lives with minimal problems. 
Singapore is moving into a transformation into an aging  society. 
Lastly, the opposite party argues, that all employees involved in the project have the strong sense that safety is a fundamental value since it requires them to attend a Construction Safety Education ( SAFE ) class before commencement  ( MOH, 2007. 
The aspect of the education in the country is  one of such that can  help in the easing of the aging problem. 
Another reason why a carrier should reveal his or hers genetic test result is because the relatives might  be able  to provide for him. 
Because of its highly efficient and enormous quantities, nuclear energy has been gaining its rapid progress in the years. 
This is because a carrier gets the disease from his or hers parents, and so the carrier  siblings and his or his children might also have the altered genes. 
And compared with the Very High temperatures reactor,  the SCRs is a reactor one, so it can produce more useful potentially usable material, which  means less  core material, such as uranium would be used to produce the same quantities . 
However, the burn of fossil fuel produces greenhouse gases, which contribute  to the effects of global temperature change. 
Moreover, Edison  made improvements in the lightbulbs while Percy  invented microwave . 
Take for example  Wellness Program in Singapore, which provides companionsage with the  seniors through  activities like  brisk walking and dancing, walking, gardening, or cycling 
An ageing population is still a problem . 
In conclusion, the SCWR  performance, costs and safety are more important than performance and cost. 
There are many alternative sources of energy which can be utilised and applied to our life ; such as, solar energy and light energy ; wind energy ; water power, water heat energy and so forth. 
''I am completely convinced that this statement is valid. 
But all inall, the advantages of limiting  public spending  outweigh the disadvantages as the poor group of the people would also be minimalysed. 
However, with a less waste generated, means that  fuel is reallocated several times 
Also, financial aid would only go to those who had no family support  through the public assistance scheme. 
Every time a vehicle is driven  on the roads, it  drains  world's conventional petroleum resource, and contribute more to world warming. 
There are many benefits of using the RFID technologies to track  people ', such as the tracking of movement of people and the prevention of crimes. 
It is not wiser to allocate a large public fund on the elderly due to the social problems, but rather, set  the sights on more pressing problems, such as an ageing population. 
Inter - Ministeral Committee on Ageing ( 1999, p7 ) states  that in the 1999,  7.1 % of its population comprises  older Singaporean aged 65 years and above and it will expect that they make up  19 %  of the  population by the 2030s. 
Out of all  human needs  in the World, to provide clean water  should be granted priority compared to other . 
In Singapore,  The Central Providently Fund Board  is a savings scheme that  any working citizen with a  list of  welfare benefits offers a  sense of  security for his old age 
Apart from that, the government's initiative in  raising the age of retirement  is also responsible to not be effective. 
However, in view of the fact that the public spends more  on the ageing issue,  the government should know how to limit  money spent  on it and also invest in other areas . 
" An energy shortage is the lack of energy, accompanied by a fact that today we can no find enough consistent energy as substitutes " is the definition given to Prof. Michael Hill from The University of Oxford. 
There are several factors that contribute to this problem. 
Having hotels,  shopping centers and transportations would generate more economic growth. 
For example, the Singapore government has introduced the CPFMedisave scheme and the Medishielding Scheme which are can cover parts of the  treatment fees, such as the patient's need not paying any deductible  and Medisield will charge 80 %  of the total expenditure up . 
In the eighteen centuries before Jenner's discovery, smallpax was a common killer disease that spread across the continent.. 
In conclusion,  important  social policies should be formulated for the aged so that the society will be prepared for an aging population . 
They think it may be very possible for some accidents to occur in  nuclear plants 
Firstly, the problem of an aging population can lead  many economic issues. 
However, for the most adult- onset conditions the knowing of a child's genetic status can not affect his or her course of treatment. 
Since then, the continuous research has been done on producing a better Generation IV nuclear reactor. 
( North,2006 ) Furthermore the state is practicing the  policy of hiding information on the safety standards for 35years, such as that only specific information on  safety standards are made known  and approved . 
It was a serenipitous  discovery made when Alexander Fleming discovered a petr - dish  bacteria left in a petrified state after he went on a holiday shopping. 
On a larger - scale, the government should be based on  advantage of the all but the aged. 
Once they are given with the new product, they are hard to convince them to change it because they don't have the necessary skills to use it. 
For instance, the inventor of the light bulb  spent his entire life to create a lightbulb with almost thirty thousand failures before it was successful. 
The step in the National Welfare Alliance will lessen the responsibility of the elderly by giving Old Folkes Home and Other amenities that  help them to live in a   . 
Thus, nuclear power is more economical compared to other energy resources. 
Although it would  be ideal to have the government not have  to bear the expenses to provide for the elderly, it would not be feasible. 
The higher cost means that it is expensive for engineers designing processes, hence groups which don't  have funding  will be  held back 
The cost of providing and old people is by far the major factor  for old people. 
Two sides support  pro and con on nuclear energy 
However, it may not be ethical to give out defective genes in order for them to fulfill their dream of becoming a family. 
However, sometimes, when there  high pressure like knowing that they are being tested positive for genetic disorders, the individual can not decide whether to make decisions correctly, while his family and professionals can take care of him and make  best decisions for them. ( Forrest, et al., 2007 ) 
In the case  Toshiba's first laptop, Tetstreet Mizog, a Japanese company, wanted to invent a laptop that would solve the problems that most Japanese company faced,  crowded offices, which prevented  usage of desktops. This was the situation Tetstya Mizogawa, a Japan's chief designer, encountered in the Toshiba laptop. 
In Singapore, the elderly are  entitled to  a subsidy  75 per % of the fee charged at  polyclins and even Free medical service  for the frail or the disabled elderly 
The right and wrong on the use of surveillance technology for the public  has been a hot issue for many years. 
For comparison, the VHRT can not recycle its fuel waste  because of this, the   demand  increasing ( , 2007. 
Since the human  life expectancy  has generally been increasing over the years, it has been essential that the elderly could working and earn a more income . 
With such detrimental effect on health, and on the human rights to privacy, the use of surveillance technologies such as the RFID for tracking people should not be banned 
Therefore, the  gas - moder fast reactor  better than  sodium - cool fast reactor in cost. 
For example, the broadband cost in India is still one  high in the global world,  simply because there are not a few who are unaware of it and therefore not a very lot of the people want to pay it. This forces the  ISP ( Network Providers ) to increase the revenue margin per customer. 
Moreover, surveillance technologies are vital in safeguarding the safety  of the public. 
After the aged have retired, there is a large  group of  who actually  still work,  they are capable of doing minor jobs that will support themselves 
Thus the importance  of education  equally important 
Critics often said  senior citizens are the country  pioneers and they have been through a process of national building and they are our responsibility . 
This has significantly enhanced the precision and accuracy of intricate surgery as well ; and it has reduced much of  risk faced during surgical procedures. 
From its communication to other invented usages , economic  and military  have played  a positive roles in its  development. 
The second strategy  is the raising of the aging age to 60. 
For countries with a small population, such as those of Singapore , there exist the need for recruitments of foreign talents . 
The setting up  senior citizens 's corner can be a platform to interact among the aged, especially  travelling out from their houses. This would be a form of interaction among them, especially if they are travelling out  of their houses, and this would be an form of self - esteem. 
Public spending on  aged should not be limited, so that the money can be diverted into other areas for the country's development to achieve higher efficiency, and to achieve better allocation  resources. 
In fact, it is not necessary to be afraid because of the fact that this point is made. 
"  Research on waste handling and reproasing is still going  for the  SFR . 
These help the authorities to solve  criminal cases especially traffic cases  in the shorter time. 
For example in Japanese, a place where earthquakes happen often and where engineers are trying to find a solution to the problem, their engineers are  trying to  solve the problems of building buildings that can survive earthquakes. 
But the controversy over the elderly ability to generate greater wealth in contrast to the lesser working adults has deterred much private companies 
Instead, governments could  reallocate  funds initially  for childcare facilities . 
When China tries  to promote the engineering design processes for innovations  these are  problems China needs to tackle. 
The fundamental problem concerns the lack of social problems underlying, which have contributed to  stressful ageing processes. 
Due to the changes in beliefs and morals of the young generation in  21st century, Many of them  hope to  achieve freedom  in their finances  and personal life  and thus deem  staying with  their aged  to be a burden to . 
This is preferred to increasing the retiring age because of a higher  retirement age  which might cause  older workers being less employability as they  are no  cost competitive, and resulting in them being laid off even before  they are 52 ( cited by MOM ). 
Therefore funds should be diverted into the education of the citizens who are able  the country in the  future. 
Throughout the years there has ever been a debated on whether technological technology shapes societies, a technological determinist viewpoint, or whether society shapes technology, an technologically deterministic perspective. 
However, due to overwhelming possibilities of error,  introspection of potential sources  is practically impossible in the design phase. 
According to studies, 
Besides solar heating systems, engineering designs are also used for other fields . 
Erroneous individuals'action is critical link in the chain. 
And there are even a lot  that contribute  to technology 
This can greatly reduced human errors that may have occurred during work, and which may have been minimized 
This step is initiated by creativity in creating new ideas .

Through these various aspect, it also shows that the governments have been taking a more prudent approach in  taking care  the elderly, and that the public spending  on the elderly should not  be used to  express their concern towards the latter. 
The elderly are given  a subsidy for chronic illnesses like diabetes and hypertension and higher cholesterol. 
It not only uses for the purposes of security, but also for the convenience of residents, since they does not have  to use key or worry  about thieves 
The great breakthrough  in  research also suggests the VHRTR doesn't require intermediate refriging, thereby eliminating the likelihood that accidents will occur. 
Scientists have estimated  given the world's current global , we  only have enough oil reserves  for another50 years. 
These private information might also be accessible by other party as the  can be encoded and may also Be subjected to  viral threats 
Till date the world's nuclear industry  created a mess without a solutions ( safety, cost, pollution, radioactive emission etc.. ) and the current growing rate of nuclear power has not been able to play an essential role in the future world. Research and development funds for developing the VHWR must be increase while addressing the public concerns over safety and improvement design to reduced costs and improving performance. 
Thus, once the dislocators are relocated from their initial destination,  a signal would be sent out to inform the shop . 
Therefore, continuous funding on national defense is deemed to be important to maintain peace and stability within the  society. 
Critics may argue  that the Security measures used on the nuclear plant are adequate, and these will endanger  the safety  people living nearby the nuclear nuclear power plants. 
Frequently updates can also be avoided. The reliability of this vending machine is guaranteed 
Virtual technology was initially developed to resolve the needs of an extensive range of communications. 
To ease the ageing process, governments'public expenditure rises steadily , leaving the countries a  financial burden  ( Joumarard,2004 ). 
Governments and policymakers  a basic national infrastructure  which provides  elderly - friend friendly communities 
In most countries , education  is considered as one of a fundamental sector  that the government can  develop and  improve on.. 
They might also have been turned down jobs. 
One of the reasons that determined  and shaped  technological innovation was the country's economic status 
" Need "  refers to the desire or need of a particular item, and may be viewed as a necessity or a means of luxury 
The number of  fatalities from the 1970s to 1992  is 31, for nuclear reactors, 31 and for coal gas. 
Further research and funding for generation IV nuclear reactors, particularly those with Very- high - temperature reactors ( VHRTR ) should be funded. 
Owing to their public'concerns about  safe operation of nuclear power reactors, research funding for  nuclear power is rather minimal.. 
It is just  like a sword, you can cut fruits  or for the bad  ( kill somebody ). 
Thus, economic growth is a crucial indicator of the capability of the government to deal effectively with the aging problem . 
In 2008,  total expenditure  in China was RMB 884 billion  which is almost 3.4 % of  total GDP  ( Ministry Of Finance of the China,2008 ). 
The success seems  too far  for the general public to . 
Therefore psychologists are required to be present in the designing process to be able to detect  human errors and to help guide engineers in the new design process. 
However, there is important lessons  that can be learned from this incident which can help improve the design  of nuclear reactor. 
All these statutory bodies and institutions required funds to  their operations in ensuring Singapore ', such as revenue earned, to be competitive, such the revenue generated can be used for other ministries  policies usage 
Most of the research has shown that  carelessness by the operator was a factor in the disastrous explosions. 
Friedland and  Laura Summer  ( 2005  ) state  the key words in fighting  an aging population are economic growth and economic growth 
This can allow  the rest  to go to the same test to decide if they had developed the genetic disorders 
Supporters argue that  nuclear power  will contribute  to the nations by the using of hydrogen . 
In addition, family members can also  reduce the risk  the next. 
For my home China, though its design processes for innovation have been improved, there is still a large number of factors which hinder the innovation  significantly. 
While it is still true that this event may  occur,  with the advancements of technology, tighter regulations will be in place to help ease the problem. 
Other than that ; in a crashing test,  occupants of the lighter vehicle would suffer from lower damage compared  a heavy vehicles ( insurance , 2009  ). 
Industrial engineering is  designing multiple manufacturing  products while  is the second oldest of  engineering fields. 
Because of market demand, researchers  have to go overloaded so that they can come out with the technology  faster. 
This act is an  policy mentioned in Prime Minister's Speech 2009 
However, none  can be  ideal energy for us now. Due to the technical problems, economical concern,  potential dangers . 
These new reactors will also be more reliable, and resistant to proliferation, as well as being able to produce less plutonium ( Generation VI, 2009  ). 
However, except in electricity generation ; the future  GFR will achieve an adequate thermal performance  based on  Brayton cycles. 
For example, the tax relief on adult children who live alone with aged adults has been raised to $ 3000 and the CPF housing grant scheme to encourage them to stay close to their parents 
The Ministry of Health has decided  to make  efficient accessibility screening  affordable and  convenient for  needy aging populations in Singapore 
Besides, the Hydrogen technology is progressing rapidly. 
Only then we  increase our capabilities and independence . 
For instance, a higher birth rate will surpass death rates, improve the physical environment through creating barrier- free access and continual efforts to R& D, and continue the R&C is some of  necessary areas . 
In addition,  the government  has long  enforced individual saving through the compulsory CPF. Propelling the populations to save  their old  age ( wijaya ). 
In addition, According to a study by the research group on such kind  reactor, concrete structures used in a reactor can survive a deliberately crashing by a  military jet 
Thirdly, the RIF improves patient identification accuracy in hospital 
Every year, the governments take  serious consideration on the allocation of their allocated public spending 
Therefore, it could be seen  that the governments'involvement in  promoting environmentally- friendly vehicles affects how marketables electric vehicles were. 
With proper policies , countries may find themselves unable to increase  their budget for the aged. This can also means that more money can be spent on other areas . 
While elders care  will inevitably comprise a large proportion of expenditure , the consequences of this inappropriate budget is that the financial load of raising funds which results in mounting a heavy load of debt and raising the tax. 
Instead, it is used on areas of the country's development to address the root of the problems and improve its quality of lives. 
Such a approach can also be seen among countries like Japan, where employee have obliged themselves to contribute a part of the monthly salary into their Central Providence Fund ( CFP ) Account 
However, they are also aware that, developing a policy which can eliminate  this trend, is close  to impossible  in the long run as  the two  sources of a aging population , higher life expectancy and low birth rate, are  unable to . 
However with the development of generation  reactors such  VHRT, the problem of radioactive wastes disposal and  high cost for electricity generated from nuclear power plants will be eliminated. 
Aged still remains as a symbol of respect to the elderly. 
As humans age, metabolism rates and immunity to start to fall, limbs, body organs such as kidney, liver, hearts and other organs will start . 
The hydrogen produced could be used for automobiles,  which in the turn helps decrease the amount of carbon emitted by 30 percent when compared  modern day engines ( , September2009 ). 
As for healthcare services, it was not reasonable for the elderly to have free  treatment for  all kinds . 
Therefore, it would be prudent for people  to remain wary of the effectiveness  promoting co- residence in enhancing the quality  care of elderly by adult children 
These are laws  that the physicians adhere to, and which the patients may be untarnished in, despite  pre - test counselling 
Next, Butler  states that an incident such  Chernobyl  which has occurred years earlier, left the public to  be highly affected, thus being doubt against the overall performance of  new generation  nuclear reactors  proposed by  GIF. 
As a result, seldom designs are applied to practice. 
Another fatal technical problem is the choice of the chosen control rods for the reactor. 
( Ministry of Communications Development, youth and sports [ MYCC ],  2001 ). Policies were implemented, implemented , refooked  re - debated and re- implemented with a goal of minimising the impact  the problems associate with an aging population. 
This will be  further improved to as the countries develop  other aspects such as technology, technology and economy 
national health health care expenditures have been keeping at 4 percent of Singapore  gross domestic profits ( GDP  ) (  ) Although health care  will inevitably  rise in  years,  the government has introduced the new 3M which will help  needy people in their health care expenses. 
The government should encourage its citizens to  have more babies so that the  burden of the taking care  of the aged is spread across a larger  affluent future generations ( Peterson  2001,  ). 
Nowadays, much people still oppose nuclear power as  its so- called danger, its  heavy metal pollution and the danger of its waste 
The HDB's housing policy  encourages families  stay closer  to their  parents, and allows elderly people to continue to  role as  grandr parents. 
With financial capacity , the elderly would not be the burden to their families 
It may not be only unnecessary distress, anxiety and anxiety for relatives,, but it will also affect family secrets, namely adoption and parentages ( Doukes, & Thompson, 2001. 
People who do  not agree with the statement that psychology  can be useful in engineering design work demonstrate its purpose. 
So what type  foods should the elderly consume ? 
To a large extend, current policy implemented has not helped to ease  aging process in the way that it may have been intended. 
An accident might occur which may also  result in  death. 
To conclude,  it would  be very beneficial for the government of China to limit  spending on  aging, because it would divert the funds to other  areas of  country's development. 
Therefore, further research  funding for nuclear reactor plant should be further researched and developed 
With more educated youths, the  size of an economy and the tax base  will be increased and the burden of the aging population will be spread across a larger  productive future . 
Each person has his or hers own opinions about the issue. 
The government also needs to make a  policy regarding  public spending  which states  how much  public funds should be used to support  aged. 
Out of the several fourth generation reactors currently being researched, the very high temperature reactor, also called the VHR, is one  promising one. 
Nevertheless, the nuclear reactor would bring about the process to more efficiently by using a higher temperature and there would be no wasted go to  outside world 
In the awareness  of this population, countries such as Japan and the Singapore have established ways to tackle the aging problem. 
All these major  factors have led many countries in to start researching for alternative energy sources to replace  the use of fossil fuel. 
As long as the government considers solving these issues, like encouraging the working from homes, the policies may be effective. 
Aging, a biologic process which Every single normal person in this earth must experience  every day , has became a quite  serious problem  for some governments in the recently decades. 
Conversely, others may argue that  not limiting  public spending  means that less budget will  be allocated  other areas  such as the education, the defence and the health sectors 
It provides monthly  cash  to help paying the  out -  expenses for care of the severely - deaf person "  ( Healthcare Finance - ElderHealth Care ). 
" They're able to see a book, but they don't necessarily know what a sign is, said the development team. 
Lastly, the education system has to be reviewed  in order for the country's future to be bright and prosperous. 
To define the problems, three key needs can  be identified. Firstly, the needs of the consumers can be improved. Secondly, the need of the market can be enhanced. Thirdly,  the need for the market to be enhanced can be better. 
After they search  the information  for their educational use,  they simply followed the original trains of thought as they thought about a new solution for their own sake. 
The practice of monitoring technology is essential for the benefits of the majority as they adopt it to improve the quality of our lives. 
Innovation engineering has become a commonly repeated phrase among  industries in  recent years 
Even though a correlation is unknown here,  it is  the study by sound that prompted the thesis on this design 
It is normal for tax - paysers to be very concerned about how policy  makers make decisions on how to spend their money, as they are very concerned with how the policy makers are making the full use  of their hard earned money. 
The Energy Department  recently released a industry estimate which is that a re - recycling plant with a annual capacity  2,500 metric tons  would cost  $ 20  and the cost of reprocessed spent fuel  $ 3.5 to $4.5billion per year 
These reinforced pellets  extremely heat resistance and don't crack easily. So even in the case of  a meltdown the uranium  pellets will not be able  to retain  radiation and  fission product within its  core with little release to  surroundings ( , 2007. 
If they were  Singaporeans, it is unlikely that they would have air - bus flights in our sky. 
Scientists have also carried out other studies, and proposed  other strategies for life extension 
There must have  a very, very close relationship and a close relation between each phase of operation . 
Granted, we could not deny their impact, such, as Chernunkhain and Three Miles Island accidents and the new technologies can eliminate  the possibility  of these accident. 
As the growing ageing population has brought about the need for organs, there is a need for organ - related products to be produced for the transplation. 
However, we  consider who has to be given the most priority and deserves the national budget . 
The application of the tracking technology had sparked heated debates between the public and the private sectors 
Nuclear - related issues have always been an important issue of the modern system of legal justice. 
Such cases are typically examples of the how a technology is shaped in terms of economic factors, in  that the technology being produced is directed by the corporations'profit earned instead, and that the one offered is the one offering the consumer the most. 
For example, The United States  spends more money in heath cares than any others nation in The world,approximately 15.7 % of the GDP and expects to reach the 19.0 % of its GDP by the year 2017 ( author, year ). 
This might also leads to the signs of withdrawal, which may also lead  to the withdrawal of part of population who are likely to choose not  medical help because of their affordability . 
It is through these approaches, pressing the issues such, such as the economic implications for an aging population, that the government can be more effective in resolving the problems. 
As a result , the  aging population's reliance on the government may lead  unexpected problems  such as Overspending  on this  and the lack of funds to invest  in other areas to develop the countries. 
This increases the level of security and efficacy for the surveillance system in a specific area that is incorporating the RFIDs technology. 
Dealing with an increasing demand of energy and  the threat from global warming, by worldwide nations, the GEN IV International forum ( GIF, 2004  ), has come up with a six generation  nuclear reactors, which are believed to  be able  to deal  with the problem of global temperature ( Butler  2004 ),. 
Engineering psychology can also be understood to be a study of humans'behaviors,  as well, as designing  mechanical devices, or artificial environment to improve humans'interaction with  systems, and  to satisfy the anthropometric, psychological or other physical requirements so as to satisfy human needs ( Wicken & Kramer  1985 ) 
This causes social problems which concerns the ability  young to provide for a larger  population. 
Thus, it  persuades the surveillance technology of the government to prohibit its use in tracking people 
There are various  profitable organizations  all over  the world which seek to cure common illnesses among the elderly such as Parkinson's Institute and The Clinical Center . 
Among the possible solution to global cooling, the  technology that is to be developed should be solar cars ; because it can not only solve the emission problem, but can also take advantage of natural resource. 
On top of this, with the better economy and the elderly being able to earn more incomes, the government will be more lenient to help the elderly in their retirement. 
Secondly, for the Ministry of education ( 2009  ) in the Singapore, funding must be committed to educational institutions. 
The people are  Singapore and  contributed to Singapore's strength and stability. 
Singapore is practicing  open market . 
For example, the Singapore government is committed to improving the mobility for the elderly by extending lifts to stops on every level in public accommodation. 
Japan and Singapore are fighting the aging  society for a long time, where the births rate is at a low level and better health care facilities are  available. 
In conclusion, although Singapore's efforts in establish herself as a Home for Innovation , engineers are compelled to  lack resources and  inflexiblity of the society. 
Nuclear power will bring an important contributing role to our  energy needs. Together with other alternative sources ( European,2007 ), nuclear energy will make a significant contribution to the future energy demands together with nuclear energy. Hence,  to produce  nuclear energy . 
In comparison to the older generation reactors, Generation V reactor will cost more and has better safety features. 
Early detection allows a carrier to be notified of his genetic condition early when the problem is  still at the infant stage ; thus the problems will be easily controlled as compared . 
However, in  2008,  cost of energy generated from a nuclear plant has increased to 19 cents per kwhatt - hours, whereas  has remained constant throughout the years 
New, refers  any building which comes after the BFA. 
Similar concept has also been tested  in O, Japan. The test run  successfully as it reaches its operating target of 950 degrees Celsius. 
Much investment has been put in this research in defeating this sickness, which is now and will continued to haunt  old aged people. 
In conclusion, individuals requesting genetic test results should have their final say on whether to disclose the results  to protect themselves from discrimination . 
A lot of countries are racing to reach the Moon and get this  that is what helium-2 is all about. 
Children are the futures and the hope of our societies, for  they provide the enthusiasm, vigor and determination towards new technology and societal improvement. 
However, some unguaranteed technologies were created by accident . 
In conclusion, the usage of such technology to monitor people not just infringes on human rights but also intrudes upon the dignity  of our Children. 
One might even  be excluded  from health coverage when  one 'd have one 'ed an abnormality. 
Another problem, is the financial issue . 
In order to  this an active policy,  older workers'skills must  be upgraded, and kept  consistent with  demands. 
Secondly, both the technologies are developed in a long period of hard work. 
This may sound great and interesting, but with  current economic , there will be less economic development, tougher decisions need to be taken to cope  the demand for the society 
Furthermore, it was important to point out that social policy should be  flexible so as to accommodate to the demands  society at the different points in time. 
The other main concerns are the health hazards. 
If large expenditure was to be allocated in helping to the elderly , the child may in turns be reliant on the Government to support his aged family  instead of  both parties . 
In conclusion,  sufficient evidence shows the use, during the designing process, of psychology  have largely reduce the chance of the Chernunk Accident  considering psychology can help to help to  pay more attentions to the significance of safety . 
On the other, the Safety Design factor comes from the effort to overcome  currents difficulties, heat- resistance fuels and material, high burn - up, and temperatures control. 
Hence, we  only needone nuclear accident  to cause more damage than what a nuclear plant might bring to  more than fifty years. 
In addition,  an increasing  number of  private cars owner converting their traditional petrol fuel - powered cars into  CNG - cars.

This shows that the elderly are never a useful person in  society. 
And as for the VHRT, a whole lot of technical challenges have also remained unaddressed. 
Since the very highly temperature doesn't recycle waste, the problem  people may misappropriate the technology would be resolved. 
Moreover, inadequate policy will lead  political and moral issues so  not setting  a limit to public spending . 
After all, . 
The civil ware on US disrupted the ice trading. 
But these people are very much interested in the genetic technologies.

In fact, the coal is a alternative raw materials to manufacture plastic in place  oil which  will be exhausted in 40 , meaning  coal will take much less time than  oil. 
Hydrogen fuel has been considered the Energy for the next several centuries since it was carbon -free, non- toxic,  less fire- risk, more efficiency than gasoline. 
These two policies  help the aged to have a  better and a easier life in their twilight decades. 
Therefore, with a good strategic plan by the government and the knowledge of its citizens, limiting the spending on  the aged will be feasible. 
The third point is that the SFR had the earliest deliveries year, 2010, than SWRC. 
Second mistake is  contractors underestimated the capacity to load the temporary structures. 
Statistics from The center for Disease control ( USA  ) show that " 88 percent of those above 65 years old have at most one chronic disease ; nearly40 % of death in America  can be caused by smoking, physically inactivity  poor diet  or alcohol , and almost20 % of elderly people suffer from  mental disorders that are NOT part, normal aging 
However, many others innovations are generated in a conventional environment. 
In order to help the most out of the restricted budget for the aging population , the government should focus its efforts to support the elderly who really needs aid such, as older singles. 
It can be attach with a small medicine package, and put the  directly into a damaged spot 
Thus, environmental  have been pushing businesses and government for 'greener'energy  with sustainability 
It is hardly  what many  nuclear research organisations  asserted,  to have  Chernobyl incidents. 
During the maintenance stage, the psychologists could advise the maintenance crews to be even more serious with their work and to be as careful with their safety as they have years of experienced. 
For SFR it saves cost in two  methods :  reactor vessel  and fuel . 
For example,  nuclear weapons proliferation by North Korean  has sparked a regional arms race, which has caused neighboring countries to purchase additional sophisticated weaponry . 
For many years  opponents to these plans believed  European style welfare states are the perfect model where healthcare care should not be accessible . 
These are clearly evident in Singapore''s Marina Bar, which was once a hotbed of anti - aging activism. 
The government faces tremendous challenges as  increased in  proportion of the elderly aged 75 years and over grew from 6.4 to 8 percent in  2007 ( Singapore Resident population, 2003 ). 
For the Chernobyl incident, there were five major designs errors (  Frot  2000 ), which were : a design error, a design failure, a failure of the system, a technical failure, an accident, and a technical problem. 
Their contributions not just benefit themselves, they also  share their valuable experiences with them. 
Firstly, the national budget is to be spent  on more important areas of a country's development. 
Multi - Tier housing schemes are introduced to help married children living together under a roof with their parents or their parents . 
( Martin,  1981 ). The accident resulted from the lack  communication between  designers and  constructors 
The most important issue should be  education, . 
This is proven  by another study which has indicated that 550  people had were denied employment, or insurance , not because of their genetic defects ( Genetic information and the workplace, 1996 ). 
There are plenty  functions now, but the best is to come up with the best one. 
Nuclear plants are a complex system which involve operations of many system simultaneously. 
This does not address MSR ; as it uses a non - weapons grade fissionable fuel which make it no chances for people  misuse the work to develop weapons. 
( International atomic energy Agency, 2009 ). Because of this, the Safety of engineering designs is very vital. 
This eco - cars have no fuel tanks ; therefore, they produce no pollution at all 
For example, surveillance systems are presently being researched to enable the aged  remain in  homes longer than they are treated with the chronic diseases . 
For example, companies have produced " lifestraw " , a mobile device that uses safe drinkables to  by removing micro bacteria through  filters. 
First mistake is that contractors used incorrect soil analysis  early on in the design phase. 
If the medications were successfully improved and Parkinson's disease was fully controlled, Parkinson  would be highly treated. 
This scheme might solve the gerimental issue ; if the oldster are working and the youngsters are working, the youngsters will not view the elderly as being useless people . 
The reprocessed nuclear waste is incorporated in  SFR. 
Also LFRs have better fuel efficiencies than SGRs as LGRs have lesser specific powers, 45KW/kHM compared  65KW, which is a much better power compared to the SGR. 
In addition, the elderly are  higher life expectancy  and living a longer life due to  advancements in medical health care and technologies 
It is expected that in the future, the issue will become more severe 
Lastly, the VHRT enhances safety characteristics and eliminates sophisticated backup system or experienced operator so as  minimise  human intervention 
The problem that hamers the designing process is that the shortage  testers to be tested on the products, for  which according  the article, there were no deaf children  in Singapore  to test the product. 
In fact,  public funding  the welfare for the aged  is still necessary in some form, but it should not be so crucial  until it  comprise such  huge section  of government spending 
mankind's battle against global warming is the catalytic catalyst that catalyzes the search  for the abundant sources of renewable energy. It is one of  few positive impact of the Global catastrophe that  we are facing. 
From kitchen appliances such as the refrigerator to the home entertainment system, these things are things we often use them for. 
Moreover, different team of engineers may have a different point  regarding safety . 
The first limit of the development for the Hawk - eyes is its cost. 
Research and development of Information Technology has allowed resource managers to be simpler. 
On top of this, the elderly who have disabilities and suffer from chronic illness would need  large sums of money  to relieve them from their conditions. 
The Chernobyl incident in 1986 is a reminder  of the important role of  safety. 
This can be achieved by analyzing fingers prints, identifying facial features, scanning of the iris and so on. 
Take China for example, the Chinese culture for innovative engineering design . 
This would rather lower the chance for getting the cancers if preventatives measures have were taken earlier

In Japan, there is a shortage of nurses and this is because of the lack of manpower in the future. 
These essential courses  consume a great deal of money . 
In other words  in 10 year time, the half of current employed citizen at work will have retired 
Mahal and Bennett ( 2006a ) mentioned  that per capita health and health care expenses of the elderly are generally much higher than those of non - elders. 
In extreme cases  if the children are born, they will be burdened by the burden of taking care of them. 
Recently, it  been reported that the depleted of fossil fuels is getting fast and it has led to higher energy cost. 
Yes, they were right,  but they were just comparing the SWCR to the generation  reactors, and not GGR reactors. 
However, one person should have his right to decide whether he wants to tell his genetic test results to his third party 
However this doesn't solve the issue of an aging population in the short run. In fact it may hinder the development of a nation. 
The new touch -less keyboard  even let the users  input without  movement .

Nevertheless, the budgets for healthcare are not unlimited, so , the governments and policy developers must decide on which extent  they would allow healthcare cost for an individual to be adjusted according to his own finances capacity. 
Some might argue for the seniors  which will reduce their productivity. 
In conclusion, the LFR  much to offers to mankind, especially in the terms of security, safety, sustainability, as well, environmental effects 
Besides that,  Friedland  suggests that, " with adequate economic growth, there are  more choices, fewer persons on need, and there will be more choices about which health care service to cover which, which will in turn, cost less. 
Yet, reproving the radioactive wastes and recycling the salts seems to be feasible in MSRs. 
For example in the United States, it has already been estimated that more than half of Federal domestic spending  outside of investment goes to  65 and above. 
According to scientific measurements, the number of energy produced per unit of hydrogen is around 2.26 times as high as fossil fuel 
Though the deployment costs are high at the present,  the burden is shared by many countries supporting the technology 
The Generation IV international forum ( GIF, 2006 ) has chosen six nuclear system which have  potential to become commercial electricity generators and in the opinion of the Generation IV world's leaders, the Supercritical - Water - cooled Reactor ( SCR ) and  very high - temperature reactor . 
In spite of the fact that VHRT has some advantages, it also faces some technological challenges. 
Man - made emission releases great amounts of carbon carbon dioxide, which causes  large amounts of " green gases " 
Size is also a factor to be consider because too much will not  be appropriate for a patient . 
Although there is a certain ambiguity of the VHRT, I feel strongly that with  current technology advancements, the limitations will be eliminated. 
Only when the aged population issue becomes well managed and can then  desirable outcome for the country . 
( Economist Intelligence, 2007  para 1. Over the  decade, Japanese has created much new technologies, creative innovation and in different field such electronic industries, transportation  nanotechnology and nanobots. 
Having a superior elder care system, does not necessarily mean having great success . 
( Robert and  Laura, 2006 ). Since no differences are expected, it is best to try to limit the amount  we can afford to pay  for high expenditures on the elderly . 
At present,  median age in Singapore is 36.7 (  ) and  it is projected that if the current demographic trend continues, the average age will reach 41 years old by 2030 and lag behind only Japan. 
The similarities between the two reactors is both using the helium as an coolant and no need to work at high pressures and producing the same output  hydrogen and electrical energy. 
Unfortunately, there are pro and cons among the population about the revelation of the results of genetic tests, whether they should be disclosed or not 
With the advancement of science and technologies nowadays,  the level  of danger  of  nuclear reactors is minimised.. 
Of course, a surveillance technology do have its advantages in terms  safety and  security but do it outweigh  undesirable problems ? 
In the long term, the developments of SWRC could also be provided solutions to  environmental issues. Ultimately, humankind needs to accept a new technology confidently and ethnologically that might help bring about unexpectedly improvements to  world. 
This had allowed  them to  be a monopolist in the  industry. 
However, it was wrong to view the aged  a burden because the  aged are a national assets who should be neglected . 
Hence, the usage of renewable energies is very crucial, in the future of our planet. 
In order to verify or rule  out a suspect genetic conditionor determine a particular person 'es chance of contracting a genetic disease depends on  results from the genetic tests. 
However, no doubt whether it was created purposefully or unintentionally  and both required  creativity and innovation as well, and some coincidence . 
Thus, to protect relatives or their parents from thinking negatively, an individual who has a known  genetic risk ought not to be obligated by his or hers. 
For example, Western powers like the countries in European and the U States are planning to build large scale solar energy farming in areas like the desert to substitute generating energy . 
In addition, the increment of the age encourages  oldsters  to be  active and contribute to  society. 
Apart from this, China doesn't attach as many attention to technology innovations  many other developing countries. 
Genetic testing is a study of the one 'ing his or her genes, chromosome and protein, to determine if a person  a certain type of disease or whether the one is a carriers or not. ( Cancer.net,2009 ). 
Technology determinism argues that technology's progress along its  path, independently of social developments. 
In the process  developing them engineers can  follow the  engineering design process described in  2005 ) 
That is the problem with energy. 
Most of them  have trouble adapting to new technologies when they have already been familiar with the  background that the devices they are currently equipped with are in. 
Therefore, a border to  spending on the elderly should  be set  so that the burden of the future generation can be shifted to future generations. 
Suppose a human  scientist was  during the designing process. He probably would have reminded the engineers of the track to prevent the accident. 
It is undeniable, that spending  on the elderly is important ; however, spending on them is important. However, we must not neglect  more important , such as education and the economy, to make the future generations don't suffer  the same problems again. 
Other than relying solely on the government and military , the governments have to educate  the public of the dangers  terrorism and  the importance of being prudent in taking precautions against them. 
In addition,  additional healthcare resources can improve health of  elderly, and hence, enhance the productivity  aged. 
Children who are failing to do  may be given up to  $ 5000 . 
For the SGR 500 centifuge degree, it is the appropriate working temperature. This means the ideal working temperature for it means the minimum efficiency for the system is fifty percents. 
Low self - confidence grows in the heart of the aged. It can cause emotional instability, particularly when they are the head  of the household in the present. 
From the book of Nicoll Road Collapse by extracted from the New Civil Engineers ( 2005  ), the Nishimatatsu - lum Chang (  ) was the party who had the responsibility in the design and the construction of Nicol Highway Collapses. 
Singapore being a  small country  with only six82. 7 sq km  ( CIA  World Fact Book, 2009  ) faces  land scarcity problems. 
That is also how many countries have been engaging in establishing effective systems  to encourage people to use money for future use. 
Nowadays,  scientific advances no longer  norm,  our understanding  genes and  diseases have deepened into. 
Although some products might take a longer time, such as an artificial heart instrument, an engineering person should not fear  taking risks and time consumed. 
However, there is another area that requires cash inflaming to facilitate  society . 
( Kelley,, 1996. As for  collapse accident ). As a result, if anyone was responsible for the collapsed accident, it would have been avoided. 
In conclusion, a carrier of known genetic risks is obligated  to tell  his or hers relatives so as to prevent future spread of his genetic disorder. 
They are most effective and require a less resource - efficient system to operate as compared to the fossil fuels . 
When a change routes during flight the route will require some  time before  pre - . 
Ethics issue such, whether an individuals requesting genetic tests should have  final say on revealing the result, remains shady 
There is no question about the problem caused by a nuclear reactor to engineering. 
Other than those technology used in development devices to assist old people with hearing and seeing, they could also be used to prevent dementia among  elderly. 
People don't  know how  to make  use of  new technologies  and new product so that  it is easily to imagine  situation where  engineering design process for innovations receives little or little funding from the society in China. 
Even if it was to be stated, there would not be any change in the premium charges  compared to  who declare that they have a family heritage but have not gone  for genetic testing. 
Failure to identify  treat Phenyleketonurium in time  may result  mental illness  later stages . 
Public spending is  essential to the country'singularity, and needs to be divided evenly. 
There is also the legal requirement that, the Privacy rule of  Health Insurance,  that the healthcare providers haveto respect and to protect patients  privacy of their health information. ( Agathe & Angstrom, 2009 )

However, it is this very idea which backfired, as the users of  phone felt personal privacy intruded to their  life. 
This way, specialized and better cares can be given for the aged. 
While this may  true,  the facts have shown that the elderly still can  contribute to  economic growth as they are more experienced when compared  others. 
Social subsidies should be assessed thus reducing unnecessary spending which in turns brings about a greater economic development. 
Thus, when the people want to  use this  insurance plan, they  use it anywhere. 
Despite this solution , the aged are still grappling with the problems of  latest technology 
Hence,  informing his relatives about the known genetic risk  has,  encourage his relatives to go . 
But due to  nature of the cells, scientists now face both technology as well as scientific problems, which hinder them from the full extent of what they can produce. 
Although figures of  WHO have showed that out  of the 80,000 people who die each day, this can not contain  the fear of people.

This is because the government is only the first line of defence against the elderly, if the government spends too much on the elderly. 
while, the appearances of the laptop were due to  working demands of workers in companies. 
However, only reactors that can generate electrical energy at high efficiencies and are viable for a long period 
The fundamental issues are when designing, it should meet its expectations, and also be safe to be operated ( Wilperpert, 2007 ). 
Therefore, the government should focus  on increasing the productivity of its future workers so that the citizens will be more independent and . 
In Singapore for example, the Government is not a sole party responsible for supporting the aging population. 
Just a few years ago, the focus of most economies was so focused on developing the countries economically that it ignored the issues of an an aging  population. 
Global warming and increased energy demands have revived the nuclear industry. 
More countries are faced with the problems that come with the aging . 
It not only reduces the material costs, but makes more accurate diagnoses, but it also makes patients less painful . 
Active ageing as a new paradigm for ageing is a key to overcoming healthcare challenges, and other  problems arising from an ageing population. 
Therefore, the research and developments/preliminary policies have helped  ease the ageing population process by people living a longer life as compared  the past 
Barry ( 2009  ) writes, solar plants generate 25times as much carbon dioxide as nuclear plants 
Surveillance technology has bring us many application varying in  our lives. 
Would there have been an elderly who had been sick long time for a while and his spending had already reached a limit? Are we going  tell him  to die? 
However, there have also been suggestions that a carrier of  a certain genetically disease who has known it through genetics testing should be obligated not to tell  his family, as he would be discriminated against and sometimes, treated as  an outlander in his families. 
This current situation could seem favorable theoretically if innovations such such as  electric cars  flourish. 
{ ( GIF ), n.d. } [  ] The selected salt mixture does not burn  air or  water and  solubilization of the fluoride salts with radioactivity in water are zero. 
GPS tracking devices help in the investigations of crimes 
In the matter  of fact  this is one of the biggest downsides for having  a robotic systems for  hospitals. 
Opponents of the RFID, may debate that encryption is used to restrict the access to information to an unauthorized person ( Data, 2006. 
This is because  elderly people have once been contributed to  country''s economies and their health should not should be overlooked . 
Also, due  the highly automated system, capital spent by experienced operators or building off site monitoring systems are reduced. 
Yet, as the society matured, one may see how inventive and novel techniques have been devised and set up to help the elderly  live on the outside of the society again. 
No wonder, . 
( , 2007  ) Hence  lack of funding resources has become the major  problem for the Singaporeans. 
According to Singapore's Department of Statistics, the average life expectancy for Singaporeans has increased dramatically from 78.1 for males and to 80.8  females ( as quoted from Press release, Singapore , 2008  ).

Furthermore, family member will be  understanding to clients and help patients financially, . 
Furthermore, users can even enable users to take  a proper a bath, rather than just being restricted by just washing themselves with a damp cloth. 
This measure curries  the elder  worry of raising healthcare costs which they found themselves more prone to in the older years 
Both the military  demand for accurate navigation and the civil demand to develop the Global Position - System ( GPS ) promote the developments of the Global positioning system. 
One nation's economy success relies on the quantity of its workforce. 
These examples show that  means - tests policy has  not fully been catered for the demands  their targeted groups. 
" However,  what if  they work harder but still are unable to afford to take care of themselves? 
In conclusion, patients should be obligated to tell their relatives regarding genetic testing result to enable their relatives to receive earlier treatment and to have early finance and psychological preparations. 
However, since the primary aim of MSRs is to ensure safe operation, it is good safety. 
thinking means students'attention. 
 
If that happens  the nation will fail  like what happened to British . 
What are therefore needs are a smart policy planning  and a close look at the way the allocation  affect our future  and society . 
According to Khandedani (2005 ),  the design processes consists of three main parts, defining the problem , gathering the required information , generating several solutions  and testing the solution . 
Gen IV systems were designed to  be highly sustainability because the energies they produce meet the aim  of clean  air,  and in  long term . 
Annual inflation rate  has been rising from 2 to 6.5 from the 2007 to the 2008 (SingStats, 2009  ). 
Another reason that has caused this  to happen was due to a higher demand for the mobile phones. 
According to Khandedani ', " What separates engineers from artists, poets, or sculptor is that they apply their creativity energies to  producing products  that meet humans's needs. ". 
Family members have the responsibility to plan  their budget early so that their children can afford  the treatments fees. 
In my point , using a nuclear energy source is the correct way to deal with today 'es increasing energy demands, due  its high efficient, environmental emissions. 
This will prove  to be  a double - edged sword . 
Genetic testing is an method that uses biochemical measurement to diagnose an individual  diseases based upon their genes. 
Compared with sodium- cooled fast reactors, the sodium - cool fast reactor is an  which has recently been developed, widely used and is now widely used. 
In order to  find a solution, Dubai  made a critical decision, which shifted its economic centers from oil exploration to tourism industry. 
The first problem with engineering design process for innovations would be the great monetary profit that the government can generate from it. 
Indeed, aging  a natural phenomenon that everyone  experience. 
Some accidents of Nuclear power plants , such the Chernone disaster occurred in 26 April, 1986 at a nuclear power plant in Ukraine, caused a huge panic over the new clean power plant

Everyone will get older eventually and  when we grew older, many may suffer from  some organ problems or mental disorders. 
Secondly, they had brainstormed  the preliminary criterion for a  better design  ( KHandani,  2005 ). 
In conclusion,  psychology could has prevented the Chernobyl accident if it were careful with the design of the nuclear reactors. 
For example,  people can  invite nurses to their homes to look for their old adults everyday or  elderly can  live in a rest home  with a lot  care. 
Therefore, public funds on the elderly should be restricted to a limited extent, so that it does not create the high probability of an economic crisis . 
Since the test involved genes and  in general , every individual has it ; the carrier  should be obliged to tell the relatives about his or hers. 
Another major issue which has been causing an increasing healthcare crisis is the increase in healthcare costs associated with the elderly. 
The first nuclear reactor was built  in Russia  in 1984, whose initial electrical production was about 5000 KW. 
The dramatic shift to age structure causes the Singapore Government to introduce  related policies 
There would not have been a dire necessity to divert the majority of the Public spending on elderly to the other areas  of the Country's developments. 
Another concern about nuclear energy sources is how they dispose of the nuclear waste which are of long - life, radioactive, toxic and recyclable. 
One of the approaches is to " replace " foreign talents with " foreign talent ". 
Although, some have argued that a breakthrough in  research does not totally sever the root problem as  who are affected by the diseases are still able to be cured 
However, the operator had broken several important rules in safety just as the test was being carried out ; he had neglected the flow control rods and disabled the automated shutdown mechanisms. The control rods were released from the system over the allowed limit. 
For example, terrorist could steal a nuclear material from a nuclear plant as easy like in the  case when  thieves broke into  shipyards in Russia. 
As people are  having longer lifespans now and  aging population  is going  to make  up a  quarter of  population in Singapore, it will be a challenge for Singapore to provide better healthcare services as more people  demand  better healthcare. 
To address such an increasing social need, the virtual world concept was taken up by the researchers. 
Although it has been an  issue that  aging population may bring a  impact on the society, more attention should be placed to the elderly, as these are important  assets to a nation. 
However, as  fact, medical procedures are certain to have a certain risk of risk. 
Imagine a scenario  : a person sitting in the front of the computer is doing the same thing, but doing the opposite thing, and is doing it in the wrong way.

The wrong attitude towards temporary structure caused them to allow off their guard and become unaware of the danger that the vulnerable structure might present. 
There is no question that China  developed fast  well since its foundation. 
For example,  many projects were to be delayed because there were not enough resources to make them work. 
These measures comprise 'force'exercises, to test'the plant  ability to respond to attacks on the plants, vehicles inspections at greater safe distance away, as well as the strict control to allow access to restricted sites. ( Source ). 
This would reduce the reliance on children  or government  to support the growing elderly population. 
As a result , this has how teenagers'privacy  is affected negatively by parents applying tracking devices to them. 
Yet another point was raised by a simple mistake found in a train's wheel. 
Hence, this role of the public should come into play in the roleplaying of addressing  the needs and needs of  aged. 
" ( Fernandez  1994 ). With a fast aging workforce and a rapidly ageing workforce, there is not a feasible plan to reduce  spending on  aged and  divert them  to other  areas of development. 
In conclusion,  people may  upset with the idea because  the aged have increasingly lacked care from  society. 
By means of the 'heart- ware'it is providing emotional support and understanding to the  aged, giving unconditional love, and understanding for them 
re (1977 ) once stated that oldage throughout this decade has been  a'socially problem '. This is true as the government has started off by all kinds  policies to  ease this issue. 
Another common surveillance technology is that  surveillance cameras are hidden in the public areas, such as street, hotels and hospital, for administration or financial purposes or security. 
If the public expenditure on the elderly is not brought under control the government would have to increase taxes to support its coffers, which can be irk  its citizens. 
And it also didn't have problems with plutonium fuel, as it served as an  which burns . 
Opponents way argues that the costs of nuclear power is not comparable to what the government pays. 
All the information gathered should be collected by the final process. 
This gene when active can produce  types of protein relating to disease of the elderly ( , 2000 ; BBC news , 1998 ). 
This need must  be taken care of in order for a brighter tomorrow- a brighter people don't need to be on bicycles or on the foot. 
The development of a nuclear power plants has become more and so important as the nuclear power has become a more and better efficient and environmentally friendly source . 
Lastly, the applications for SwR technology include ( SwR, 2009 ), aero- engine components ; land - - based turbines, helicopter blades,  military weaponry component, oil - and gas production. 
Typhoon Kettana, Katrina,  tornados and waves from the South - and South- East Asia, are some illustration examples of global cooling.

The lack of land to build a suitable facility to test  products is an obstruction . 
The difference between the serendipsitous discovery of a technology and a research is the resources  invested in its development,  how the technologies are gauged  to be successful. 
IShoe is another  product that has been developed using scientific and technology in preventing elderly people from falling 
For example, the Meizu brand, famous for producing its " Apple - inspired design music players " recently came up with the new product, M8 ( citation ). 
Where the housing apartments with high concentrations of poor elder persons are  upgraded with newer fixtures and fixtures, features like lifts modifications on every floor, support hands in the toilet, taps on the floor, and a warning alarm system for elderly who are in trouble. 
The current scheme is called  Barrier - free Accessibility . 
Fast aging population is increasingly a serious issue especially for  developed countries 
In today ', many  working age people, with  their own  and families , are subjected to considerable economic pressures. 
In a nutshell, a solid and healthy development of the country is made through a healthy outlook of the finances and an objective development plan 
However, besides spending money on the enhancement of a design, it should also be focused on the possible tradesoffs. 
Not only does it produce more electricity ; the high temperatures generated is  not useless 
Besides, building more reactors and lengthening their lifetime save money as much natural resources as land,.
